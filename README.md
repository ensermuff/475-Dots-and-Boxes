# Non-commit work done
- Researched viability of Unity v Android studio. Ultimately decided that Unity would create more tedium and hassle to import into Android Studio each time. Essentially, an .aar file would need to be created and turned into an Android Library every time the game was altered. The canvas class is now the plan for the implementation of the gameplay. - AWH 28 Feb
